## Introduction

I’ve always loved learning and getting good at doing things, sometimes I wonder which came first. I first started learning how to write poems and stories by reading books when I was younger, which helped me develop my writing skills. I enjoyed writing and continuously got better at expressing my thought with words. Around the same time, I also taught myself to play some songs and chords on the piano by listening to music and trying to recreate the melodies I heard, which led me to getting good enough to play during my school assemblies. I started teaching myself how to play football in primary school. Although I wasn't very good initially, I kept working on my skills and by secondary school, I became one of the best players in my school. Fast forward to university, I felt like my software engineering degree focused more on Java, a little bit of python, and theoretical aspects like data structures and algorithms(very important stuff btw), rather than practical web development skills which I wanted to learn. So, I taught myself web development with html/css/js, learned React, and later picked up mobile development with React Native.

These experiences showed me that while teachers and classes can provide valuable guidance, understanding how you learn best can make all the difference. In this article, I want to share my journey and offer tips on how you can discover and use your unique learning style(s) to your advantage.

## Identifying Individual Learning Styles

### Reflections on Past Experiences

One of the best ways to figure out how you learn best is to think about your past experiences. Ask yourself:

- What study methods helped you do well in school or work?
- Do you remember things better when you hear them, see them, or write them down?
- Do you prefer hands-on activities over listening to lectures?

By thinking about these questions, you can start to see patterns and understand your preferred learning style.

### Online Quizzes

Online quizzes can also help you learn more about your learning style. Websites like [VARK](https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-modalities/), [Learning Styles Online](https://www.learning-styles-online.com/), and [Myers-Briggs](https://www.myersbriggs.org/) offer assessments that categorize learning preferences, such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic styles. These quizzes can give you a better idea of how you learn best.


## Combining and Mastering Learning Styles and Techniques

### Combining Learning Styles

It's important to note that many people benefit from a combination of learning styles rather than fitting into just one category. Research indicates that multimodal learning approaches, where individuals use multiple learning styles, can be more effective. For example, you might find that you learn best by combining visual aids with hands-on practice.

### Mastering Learning Techniques

Once you know your learning style, it’s time to refine your study habits with these techniques that cater to various learning preferences:

- **Distributed Practice:** Instead of cramming all your studying into one long session, spread it out over several shorter sessions. For visual learners, use diagrams and charts in each session. Auditory learners can benefit from listening to short lectures or podcasts. Kinesthetic learners should incorporate hands-on activities, while reading/writing learners can break their notes into manageable chunks.

- **Active Learning:** Engage actively with the material. Visual learners can create infographics or mind maps. Auditory learners can teach the material to someone else or participate in discussions. Reading/writing learners might write essays or summaries, while kinesthetic learners can apply what they’ve learned in practical scenarios or role-playing.

- **Interleaving Practice:** Mix different topics or types of problems within a single study session. Visual learners can use varied charts and visuals. Auditory learners might switch between listening to different subjects. Reading/writing learners can tackle different types of texts, and kinesthetic learners can alternate between different physical activities or experiments.

- **Use of Flashcards:** Flashcards are great for active recall and spaced repetition. Visual learners can use color-coded cards. Auditory learners might benefit from saying the answers out loud. Reading/writing learners can write detailed answers, while kinesthetic learners can move around while using flashcards to keep their engagement high.

- **Practical Experience:** Applying what you learn in real-world scenarios helps solidify theoretical knowledge and enhances understanding. Visual learners can create visual projects or models. Auditory learners can explain concepts in study groups. Reading/writing learners might write reports or detailed project plans, and kinesthetic learners can engage in physical activities related to their learning.

Acknowledging that most people use a mix of different learning styles, research shows that using multiple methods can lead to better learning outcomes. According to a study by Pashler et al. (2008), combining different learning styles can help create a more effective and inclusive learning experience.

## The Outline Method for Learning

One of the best techniques I've found for learning is the outline method. Here's how it works:

### Steps

1. **Identify the Main Topic:** Start by defining the subject you want to learn.
2. **Break Down Subtopics:** Divide the main topic into smaller, manageable sections.
3. **Organize Information Hierarchically:** Use headings and subheadings to create a structured outline.
4. **Detail Key Points:** List the key points and supporting details under each subheading.
5. **Review and Revise:** Regularly review your outline and make adjustments as needed.

### Benefits

- **Clarity and Focus:** Helps organize your thoughts and keep you focused on important areas.
- **Structured Learning:** Provides a clear plan, making complex subjects easier to manage.
- **Enhanced Retention:** The structure helps you remember related concepts better.

## Knowing When To Go from Practice to Doing

I believe in lifelong learning, where the process never truly stops but changes in intensity. It's crucial to recognize when you need to transition from actively learning to applying what you've learned or taking a break if you feel burnt out. Here are some signs that indicate it's time to shift gears:

- **Confidence and Competence:** You can explain concepts clearly and perform tasks well.
- **Application:** You can use your knowledge in real-life situations.
- **Assessment Results:** You perform well in tests or practical evaluations.
- **Feedback:** You receive positive feedback from others.

Learning doesn't have to stop; it just evolves. Once you have a good general grasp of things, you might start to build on that knowledge over time, often without realizing it. This happens because you're constantly exposed to related information and experiences, even if you're not actively studying the subject.

The key is knowing when to move from practice—like reading, watching, or consuming content—to actual doing. Whether it's creating something, taking a test, or engaging in a physical activity, applying what you've learned is essential. This transition helps solidify your knowledge and skills, making them more practical and useful in real-world scenarios.

Balancing thorough learning with practical application is crucial to avoid over-studying and ensure that your learning is effective and sustainable.

## Enhancing Learning with Traditional and Modern Tools

### Traditional Methods

- **Pen and Paper:** Writing notes by hand can improve memory and understanding. I like to use notebooks for summarizing lectures, creating mind maps, and jotting down key points.
- **Books and Journals:** Reading physical books can improve focus and comprehension. I often use highlighters and margin notes to emphasize important information.

### Modern Digital Tools

- **Digital Note-taking Apps:** Tools like Evernote and OneNote help keep your notes organized and easily accessible.
- **Educational Platforms:** Websites like Coursera, Khan Academy, and edX offer courses on various subjects.
- **Large Language Models:** AI tools like ChatGPT can provide explanations, answer questions, and help with research, offering personalized and interactive learning experiences.

## Conclusion

Learning is a personal journey. By reflecting on past experiences, trying different methods, and using both traditional and modern tools, you can find what works best for you. Adjust the depth of your learning to your goals and know when you've learned enough. These strategies have significantly enhanced my learning process, and I hope they help you too.
